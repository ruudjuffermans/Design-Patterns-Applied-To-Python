The chain of responsibility design pattern allows an object to send a request to a chain of objects in order to handle the request.

- useful for situations where multiple objects may be able to handle a request, and the specific object that should handle the request is not known in advance.
- allows for the easy addition or removal of objects for mthe chain without disrupting the overall functionality
