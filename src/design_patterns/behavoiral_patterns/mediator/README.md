The mediator design patterns allows multiple objects to cummunicate without each other knowing the datails of their implementation.

- it provides a central point of communication, know as the mediator, wich acts as intermediary between the objects.
- useful in cases where there are a large number of objects that need to communicatie with each other, as it reduces the complexity of the system by seperating the communication logic from the objects themselves.
