The flyweight design pattern aims to minimize the use of memory by sharing common data among objects.
This is done by creating a shared object that can be used by multiple objects rather than each object having their own seperate instance of the data.

- we can reduce the memory footprint of our application and improve its performance
- carefully consider the trade-offs between the benefits of memory saving and the added complexity of implementing the pattern
