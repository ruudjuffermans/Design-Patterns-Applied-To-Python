The proxy design patterns provides a intermeddiary object between a client and a real subject.

- provides a placeholder for potentially expensive or resource-intensive object. the proxy can be used to create a real object only when needen, rather than creating upfront
- controll access to the real subject. the proxy can be used to enforce access restrictions or implement authentication and authorization checks
- add additional functionality to the real subject. the proxy can be used to intercept requests to the real subject and perform additional tasks before or after forwarding the request.
