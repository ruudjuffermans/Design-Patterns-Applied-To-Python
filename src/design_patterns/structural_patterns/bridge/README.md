The bridge design patterns allows for seperation of abstraction and implementation, so that the two can vary 

- abstractions and implementations should not be bound at compile time
- abstractions and implementations should be independently extensible
- changes in the implementation of an abstraction should have no impact on clients
- implementation detals should be hidden from the client
