A factory provides a way to create classes without having to specify the class for the instance creation.

- A benefit is that it provides a centralised wy of creating objects, making your code more modular
- it also allows the implementation of object creation to be changed easily, making your code more flexible and extensible.
- Allows objects to be created without having to specify the name of the class, making the code more generic.
