A builder design pattern allows for the creation of complex objects in a step-by-step manner. It seperates the construction of an object from its representation, allowing for different representations t obe created

- object creation algorithms should be decoupled from the system.
- multiple representations of creation alogrithms are required.
- the addition of new creation functionality without changing the core code necessary
- runtime control over the creation process is required
