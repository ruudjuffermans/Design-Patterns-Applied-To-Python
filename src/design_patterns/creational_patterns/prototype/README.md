The prototype design patters allows for the creation of new objects by copying existing objects, rather than creating new objects from scratch.

- usefull when creating complex objects or when cost of creating a new object is high.
- a class will not know what classes it will re quired to create
- subclasses may specify what objects should be created
- parent classes wish to defer creation to their subclasses
